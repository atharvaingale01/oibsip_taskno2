        Nikola Tesla, (born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, 
        Austrian Empire [now in Croatia]—died January 7,
        1943, New York, New York, U.S.), 
        Serbian American inventor and engineer who 
        discovered and patented the rotating magnetic field,
        the basis of most alternating-current machinery. 
        He alsodeveloped the three-phase system of electric 
        power transmission. He immigrated to the United States in 
        1884 and sold the patent rights to his system of 
        alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to 
        George Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil,
        an induction coil widely used in radio technology.
